## This file is part of the brightzz program. This program will attempt
## to control the brightness of your screen. This program is customized
## to every specific computer where it is installed, thus values below 
## should be updated to specific cases. This program should be made bound to 
## keybords key(s), as to allow user direct keyboard control (research 'keybinding')
##
## This program was created for and tested in Linux Debian 8.
