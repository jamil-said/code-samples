## This file is part of the upshutzz program. This program will attempt
## to automatically update OS & programs (without human assist) and then 
## shutdown your computer. This program is intended to be used when user 
## will shutdown computer, as they can just select this program and leave 
## the machine unassisted while it updates and then shuts down. The update 
## version used is the gentlier 'upgrade' command (as opposed to 'dist-upgrade')
## which will only update existing packages, but will not install new (not 
## previously installed) packages (lesser chance of system failure
## after botched update). That can be changed by using 'dist-upgrade' instead.
## This program will update all programs (including third parties) that 
## have added their repository address on the OS (all Debian programs plus 
## many third party ones). The program will also check for the flash plug-in
## and update it if installed. This program saves results of the updates 
## in dated logs located at /var/log/apt/upshutzz. A GUI interface appears
## to explain options and inform the user when the program is launched. Before
## the program perform the updates, it will look for and fix possible broken
## packages or failed past installations before proceeding.
##
## This program was created for and tested in Linux Debian 8 & 9.
