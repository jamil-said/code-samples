/* soccerPlayers
You have a table soccer_team that contains information about the players in your favorite 
soccer team. This table has the following structure:

    id: the unique ID of the player;
    first_name: the first name of the player;
    surname: the last name of the player;
    player_number: the number that the player wears (the number is guaranteed to be unique).

Create a semicolon-separated list of all the players, sorted by their numbers, and put this 
list in a table under a column called players. The information about each player should have 
the following format: first_name surname #number.

Example

For the following table soccer_team
id 	first_name 	surname 	player_number
1 	Alexis 	Sanchez 	7
2 	Petr 	Cech 	33
3 	Hector 	Bellerin 	24
4 	Olivier 	Giroud 	12
5 	Theo 	Walcott 	14
6 	Santi 	Cazorla 	19

the output should be

players
Alexis Sanchez #7; Oliver Giroud #12; Theo Walcott #14; Santi Cazorla #19; Hector Bellerin #24; Petr Cech #33
