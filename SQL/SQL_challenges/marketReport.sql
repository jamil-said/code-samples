/* marketReport
Your company is planning to expand internationally very soon. You have been tasked 
with preparing a report on foreign markets and potential competitors.

After some investigation, you've created a database containing a foreignCompetitors 
table, which has the following structure:

    competitor: the name of the competitor;
    country: the country in which the competitor is operating.

In your report, you need to include the number of competitors per country and an additional 
row at the bottom that contains a summary: ("Total:", total_number_of_competitors)

Given the foreignCompetitors table, compose the resulting table with two columns: country and 
competitors. The first column should contain the country name, and the second column should 
contain the number of competitors in this country. The table should be sorted by the country 
names in ascending order. In addition, it should have an extra row at the bottom with the summary, 
as described above.

Example

For the following table foreignCompetitors
competitor 	country
Acme Corp 	USA
GLOBEX 	USA
Openmedia 	France
K-bam 	USA
Hatdrill 	UK
Hexgreen 	Germany
D-ranron 	France
Faxla 	Spain

the output should be

country 	competitors
France 	    2
Germany 	1
Spain 	    1
UK 	        1
USA 	    3
Total: 	    8

CREATE PROCEDURE marketReport()
BEGIN
    SELECT COALESCE(country, 'Total:') country, COUNT(competitor) competitors
    FROM foreignCompetitors
    GROUP BY country WITH ROLLUP;
END
