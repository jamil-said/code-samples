# CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Application -- Created in a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) & Bootstrap Environment

A simple and elegant CRUD application created with LAMP and Bootstrap. After implemented (the code is 100% ready and tested, but must be adapted if a different database is used), a user can create, read, update and delete entries (in this case customer information, such as name, phone, email, etc.) directly from a web page and see the results of their interactions immediately reflected on that web page. CRUD functionality is the backbone of many applications. This CRUD app uses data validation with user-friendly error warnings and parameterized queries for security. This CRUD app is "responsive", that is, the content fluidly adapts to screen sizes and changes in browser width.
