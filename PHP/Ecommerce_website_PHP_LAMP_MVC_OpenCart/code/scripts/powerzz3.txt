## powerzz version 1.0.1
## This file is part of the powerzz program. This program will attempt
## to monitor battery levels and hibernate/shutdown the computer when the battery
## is close to be drained. This program relies on the program reaperzz to double-check
## that certain temporary files are deleted at boot.

#this is a GLOBAL switch NOT reacheable via GUI, which is NEVER supposed to be used under normal circunstances. It disables powerzz for all users regardless of preferences.  
#exit 0 #powerzz-global-switch

#sleep a little to let things load when booting
sleep 10

sleep 19

#run third instance
nohup /usr/local/bin/powerzz4 > /dev/null 2>&1 &
