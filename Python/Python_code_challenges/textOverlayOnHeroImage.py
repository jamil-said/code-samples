This code challenge gives you some pre-existing code that CANNOT be

""" textOverlayOnHeroImage -- 5 min
Implement the missing code, denoted by comments. You may not modify the 
pre-existing code.

The GoDaddy Website Builder product helps small businesses easily create 
websites. Let's say we are going to add a feature where the name of a business 
is automatically placed on top of a large "hero" image on the landing page 
of the site.

To do so, we need to find a position on the image where the text will be 
the most readable. If the text is placed on an area of the image that is 
too dark, it will be difficult for the site visitors to read it (for 
simplicity's sake, let's only consider black text on a grayscale image). 
We will define the optimal position of the text as the position where the 
mean pixel brightness inside the bounding box for the text is maximized.

You are given a grayscale image as a 2D array of pixels with the height 
and width of the text's rectangular bounding box. You must return the bounding 
box's top-left corner coordinates for the optimal text position. If there is 
more than one optimal position, return the top-left-most one.

Example

For

image = [[10,  50,  90, 65],
         [10, 200, 255, 30],
         [10, 150,  30, 25]]
height = 2, and width = 3, the output should be
textOverlayOnHeroImage(image, height, width) = [0, 1].

Both bounding boxes with top-left coordinates at [0, 1] and at [1, 1] have 
a maximal mean pixel brightness equal to 690 / 6 = 115. Thus, the answer 
is [0, 1], as it is the topmost one.

See the resulting bounding box in the image below.


Input/Output

[execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)

[input] array.array.integer image

Array of non-negative integers less than 256.

Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ image.length ≤ 20,
1 ≤ image[0].length ≤ 20,
0 ≤ image[i][j] ≤ 255.

[input] integer height

Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ height ≤ image.length.

[input] integer width

Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ width ≤ image[0].length.

[output] array.integer

Array of two integers: indices of row and column for the optimal position, 
respectively.
