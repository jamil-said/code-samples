# ETL (Extract Transform and Load) Using Python and PostgreSQL for Tableau

## Case Study: US Flights

### Scenario:
You were provided with a flat file containing data about domestic flights in the United States. You are asked to have the data loaded into a PostgreSQL database and appropriately modeled in a star schema for use in Tableau.

### Data:
The data is provided in a txt flat file (UTF-8 encoded), which is delimited by the pipe character (column headers are provided on the first line). 

### Requirements:
* Load the data into the PostgreSQL database provided (name: db_etl)
* Create and load one Fact table to contain data about the flights.
* Create and load appropriate Dimension table(s).
* Create a view that joins your Fact table to your Dimension table(s) and returns columns for analysis.

### Additional Instructions:
**Fact Table**
* Create an additional column called **distance_group** that bins the distance values into groups in 100 mile increments. Example: 83 miles is 0-100 miles. 255 miles is 201-300 miles.
* Create an additional column that indicates if the departure delay in minutes (**DEPDELAY**) is greater than 15.
* Choose appropriate data types and perform conversions to load the data from the source into these types.
* Fix obviously bad data when encountered, if possible.

**Dimension Table(s)**
* Create at least one dimension table and load it from the source data.
* Clean up the Airline Name column by removing the Airline Code from it.
* Clean up the Airport Name fields by removing the concatenated city and state.
* Fix obviously bad data when encountered, if possible.

## About the Scripts
The module **flights_etl.py** starts the process and will extract, check, fix (when possible), transform and load data from the txt file into the PostgreSQL database (the database part is done by imported module **flights_db**). The script will save a log with missing entries on **missing_data.tx**, and a log with obviously erroneous entries (not fixed by the script) on **bad_data.txt**, both logs created on the same directory where the script is run from. The logs can be used later to refine the script. The scripts are well commented and explain every step.
